            >Dan Haywood is a songwriter and ornithologist based in Lancashire,
            England, where </i
          >Dapple<i>
            was recorded at various locations in the Forest of Bowland. His
            reputation as a storyteller and performer of the highest distinction
            is gathering steam on the back of a string of choice shows with
            fellow sonic nomads including Josephine Foster, Michael Hurley and
            The Tallest Man on Earth.</i

          <br />

          "Given that <i>Dapple</i> could be set in the 18th century, I was keen
          for there to be no motor vehicle noise, just in case the listener
          might prefer to imagine it that way. So the locations had to be out of
          the way, and some of the sessions started as early as 4am to beat the
          sound of the Abbeystead gamekeepers’ Land Rovers and Bowland farmers’
          tractors. Days on which the breeze might gust above 5mph were avoided,
          which was good for reducing wind noise and for a preponderance of
          midges.<br />
          <br />

          In the spring sessions the air was alive with birdsong, and you’d wade
          into that set and make a small territory and start singing yourself,
          just a thread in a tapestry. There’s a list of avian background
          singers and scene-stealers on the sleeve. Later sessions could be
          deathly quiet and the molestation of the air was all our doing, like
          on the post-dusk title track, when the frightened words seemed to
          flash up in a pitch-black anechoic chamber. Rather than Milton’s
          darkness visible, it’s darkness audible.<br />
          <br />

          I spent half a decade making a very long-playing record called
          <i>Dan Haywood’s New Hawks</i>, which was largely a place-specific and
          time-specific suite of songs, set in places in the Highlands of
          Scotland where I lived and worked in the early years of the 21st
          century. There were huge flights of fancy and trips around the globe,
          but it always returned there – a 32-part love song to Caithness and
          Sutherland. But as a suite, Dapple is a love letter to rural England,
          although it sometimes perhaps sounds a little Danish or Austrian or
          Hungarian. <br />
          <br />

          New Hawks involved many musicians, and had a few snatches of library
          recordings of Highland birds and so forth. At the time, we were
          working in increasingly larger buildings like churches for spatial
          effects. So it seemed to be the next step to record in the outdoors
          and be part of the ambience rather than add that in. My New Hawks
          bandmate, the inimitable Mancunian composer and multi-instrumentalist
          Paddy Steer, had picked up a ’70s mono Nagra, a portable tape recorder
          used in film and radio, which audiophiles maintain is of the highest
          fidelity. I nagged him to help me with an al fresco project.<br />
          <br />

          Obviously I needed players who could work fast and sound good, and who
          weren’t addicted to post-production or overdubbing – because none of
          that was available; it was all live and set in stone. So we have Mr
          Steer, Andy Raven, Therese Standish, Richard Turner and Jeff Barnes,
          who are tasty and fearless, and all necessarily unplugged – on guitars
          and mandolins but also double basses, drum kits and harmoniums that
          got heavier and heavier as we carried them up bilberry-covered hills
          or down ferny gullies.” – DH
